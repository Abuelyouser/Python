Complete the solution so that the function will break up camel casing, using a space between words.
Example
"camelCasing"  =>  "camel Casing"
"identifier"   =>  "identifier"
""             =>  ""	
Solution:								
def solution(s):
    n = 0
    result = ""
    if s == "":								
        return s
    for i in s :
        n+=1
        if i.islower():
            result = result + i
        elif i.isupper():
            result = result + " " + i + s[n:0]
    return result


another good one:
def solution(s):
    st = ""
    for c in s:
        if c.upper() == c:
            st += " " + c
        else:
            st += c
    return st
