"""Problem 1: Anagram Check
Write a function that takes two strings as input and determines if they are anagrams of each other. 
Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase. For example, 
if the input strings are "listen" and "silent", the output should be True."""
